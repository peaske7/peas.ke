  <h2>
    Improving Test Performance by moving to Multithreaded Testing in Rust
  </h2>
  <small>July 7, 2024</small>

  <p>
    I recently tweaked the setup and teardown functions in our team's
    integration tests to allow for multithreaded test execution. Since we saw
    positive results, I thought I'd share how we implemented these changes.
    Tests are run multiple times a day before and after commits, and
    shortening the execution time of these tests improves developer
    productivity and saves on developer time.

  <h3>Set up</h3>

  <p>
    We have more than 300 integration tests in our codebase with most using a
    database instance in docker and mocking external endpoints with
    <a href="https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/wiremock-rs">wiremock</a>. We
    also took a liking to libraries like
    <a href="https://github.com/frondeus/test-case">test-case</a>, which cut
    down on boilerplate in our tests, so compatibility around these other
    libraries are were also important.
  </p>

  <p>
    To simplify the setup and teardown of these tests, we used to migrate and
    drop all database tables per each test and used the same test server.
    Naturally, only a single test could be run at any point in time.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each test run was taking around 4~5 minutes, but it felt long, and each
    test run took enough time to add a non-neglible amount of friction to
    development.
  </p>

  <p>The goals of the implementation were as follows:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Maintainability: If implementing mulithreaded test harnesses dipped too
      deep into async/thread complexity, it'll be a burden to future
      developers.
    </li>
    <li>
      Nonintrusiveness: The test harness should be easy to use and not require
      developers to learn new concepts. The implementation of existing tests
      should not change that much.
    </li>
    <li>
      Performance: The original goal of the implementation was to improve test
      execution times. If the new harness can't deliver, the added complexity,
      even little, won't make sense.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Why doesn't sqlx::test doesn't work? Constraints using sqlx::test is 1)
    The codebase needs to use sqlx 2) Using sqlx::test with other test-macros
    (like test_case) may prove difficult. For example ...
